# PaNL
# An online participant recruitment platform for Social Science and Humanities research in the Netherlands

## What is PaNL?
A sustainable, trustworthy, and user-friendly platform that provides Dutch SSH researchers with an easy access to a high-quality and sufficiently large participant pool of Dutch citizens and students, who in turn experience benefits and feel valued by contributing to research. 

## Why is PaNL needed?
Much research within the Social Sciences and Humanities relies on input that can only be obtained from people. 

Although international online platforms exist to recruit human participants, these are unusable for research bound to the Dutch linguistic and/or cultural context. Moreover, GDPR regulations prohibit Dutch researchers from storing data outside EU borders. Finally, criticism regarding existing platform's data quality and ethics signals a need for homegrown alternatives.

## How does PaNL help? 
The development of PaNL addresses the challenges faced by Netherlands-based academic researchers by providing them with an affordable, sustainable, and secure online participant/annotator recruitment platform. 

PaNL will help Dutch SSH scholars to remain internationally competitive, while serving Dutch societal research needs. It will also strengthen ties between Dutch Social Sciences and Humanities research communities.

The platform is developed by Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in cooperation with not-for-profit platform developer EYRA and established Dutch academic partner SURF. The project is funded by PDI-SSH.

## News & updates 

### **PaNL, the official name of our Dutch participant recruitment platform**

Over the past couple of months, our project team took up the task of choosing a name for our platform.

As two heads are better than one, or in this case as several hundred heads are better than a few, we decided to organize a student competition and see whether our students in the Communication Science Department and the Faculty of Humanities could help us to come up with a catchy, suitable name. We received many interesting and creative suggestions, and after several deliberations we chose our winner, a proposal submitted by one of our students Inbar Ben Gera.

So without further ado we introduce to you **PaNL** - a recruitment platform for SSH research in the Netherlands. We think that this is a fitting name as it is a word play containing a reference to a research panel (which is a group of people who participate in studies and fill in surveys) and to the Dutch context of the platform.

Weâ€™re very excited about this outcome and cannot wait to promote PaNL to the academic community in the Netherlands and to the wider Dutch society. 

### A presentation about the platform during [ICT.OPEN2021](https://www.ictopen.nl/)

On Febraury 11, 2021 Paulina Pankowska presented our project during the ICT.OPEN2021 conference. ICT.OPEN2021 was a part of the Dutch Digital Conference organised by NWO and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. 

During the presentation, Paulina first provided a short introduction to the platform and its functionalities. Then, during the interactive Q&A session, she asked the audience to provide feedback on a few mockups of the platform's participant landing page using Mentimeter. 

The presentation was well-received and the interactive Q&A session allowed us to obtain valuable feedback, which in turn allowed us to improve the mockups further.

A recording of the presentation and the slides show are provided below.
